# Train-Time

This assignment uses Firebase and MomentJS and will store information from a form on the database. Then it will get the info from the database and dynamically generate the information back onto the page and do calculations. 

* When adding trains, you will be able to submit the following information within the form:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
* This app calculates when the next train will arrive and is relative to the current time.
